/*
WeightedLeastConnectionsScheduler is a Scheduler that uses a weighted least
connections algorithm to schedule backends.

Supposing there is a server set S = {S0, S1, ..., Sn-1},
W(Si) is the weight of server Si;
C(Si) is the current connection number of server Si;
CSUM = Î£C(Si) (i=0, 1, .. , n-1) is the sum of current connection numbers;

The new connection is assigned to the server j, in which
  (C(Sm) / CSUM)/ W(Sm) = min { (C(Si) / CSUM) / W(Si)}  (i=0, 1, . , n-1),
  where W(Si) isn't zero
Since the CSUM is a constant in this lookup, there is no need to divide by CSUM,
the condition can be optimized as
  C(Sm) / W(Sm) = min { C(Si) / W(Si)}  (i=0, 1, . , n-1), where W(Si) isn't zero
